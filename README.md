> `Progress is a cumulative process.`

*Hi! I'm **Dani**, a **full-stack builder**.*

*The term **full-stack** describes me better than anything else. From idea to design, design to code, code to product, I have experiences in almost every aspect of software development.*

*The excitement of building something new is what drives me. I believe in the power of software in improving people's lives, and I always dare to make a step forward with the power of software.*

*Progress is a cumulative process, and every little step counts. Let's take that step together.*
